Important!
The mod update will be available only on the client side in the next update.
You will be able to use ElytraSwapper + on your favorite servers just with install it.

Description:
ElytraSwapper+ is a next-generation utility that allows the player to swap the chestplate and elytra whenever needed.
Dependencies (fabric only):

How it works?
1. Regular bind
The way it works is that when you assign a key in the settings (by default it's R), when you press it the elytra will swap places with the chest and elytra or back, depending on what gear you have.
2. Auto swap
This function consists in the fact that when it is enabled by bind (by default it's B), when you fall from a height higher than 2 blocks, you will automatically equip the elytra so as not to accidentally fall from a height.
 
Easy like a pie!üç∞
